# Example
This is a very simple example demonstrating how to use the `allegro_spotify` module.

# Building
Make sure that the shared library has been built, then run `make` to build the example.

# Running
The example program expects an artist and track name, then attempts to play that song, like so:

```
$ make run artist="Green Day" track="Welcome to Paradise"
```

If all goes well, you should soon hear the soothing melodies of Billie Joe Armstrong.
